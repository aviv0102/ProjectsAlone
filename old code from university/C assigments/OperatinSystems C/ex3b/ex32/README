first my info:

importent explanation:

- i called my .csv file myResults (not results) please don't reduce my grade for it

- in my linux myResults.csv worked in utf-8

- i assumed ./comp.out is in the same folder as ./a.out and main.c

- notice the program updates you during run time, and i GOT NO LEAKS ;)

thank you :)
