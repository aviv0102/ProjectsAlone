hello,

please notice we explained everything at the writeUp

as you can see each model has its own code files and results files.

how to run? simply install the needed imports and run the ex3_spiral/par/line.py 

input: will use generate_data.py in each model directory to create the data its need(different files)

output: 5 fake versions of the data plotted using matplotlib

Importent!:
there supposed to be 3 different generate_data.py file if for some reason it is not the case please download the code 
from here
