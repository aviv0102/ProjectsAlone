hello,

-please notice i commented the code, and explained how to run each part with the comments,
therefore i recommend you to check it out, we put a great effort in to this excercise to consider it :)

- also notice that each method takes about 4-7 min, and in total 20min with loading and all, during run we printed in which
stage we are and the results at the end of each phase. (method) 

thank you!
