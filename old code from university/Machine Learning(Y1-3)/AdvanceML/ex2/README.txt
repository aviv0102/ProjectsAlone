hello,

run:

- the programs require train.data and test.data as arguments
- multiclass.py contains both model 1 and 2 and currently is set to run model 2 (call for model 1 in main is commented)
- structured.py contains model 3 and heatmap bonus (call for heatmap plotting is commented-line 89)
- the last model uses matplotlib (and tkinter for running from cmd)

info:

- please notice we have accuracy and bonus in writeUp file.
- we also explained each model and compared between them at the end.
- the run time for first and second models is 1-5 min (depends on number of epochs 3-13)
- run time of last model is 5 min per epoch => 40min for 8 or 10min for 2 


thank you!
