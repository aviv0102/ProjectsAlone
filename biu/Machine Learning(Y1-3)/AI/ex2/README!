hello,

run:
- need 2 arguments train,test


info / questions:

- about the KNN:
  in a situation of there is multiple neighbors with the same distance i took the first 5 like you said.
  but the more accurate one was to look at all the neighbors with the same distance (it brings higher precentage)

- about the naiveBayes :
  1. it was not clear if k is --> word_count[word] -- number of occurrences of Xi
  		      or k is --> col_count[i] - number of options of the same row (sex=2 options),
     eventually i used the second option because someone said that is what you want,
     but i did get better results at the first one... 

  2. in case N(xi,cj) is 0 --> we did not see the combination, are we supposed to give the top of the expression
     value of 1 or 0 ?
     for a value of 1 i got higher precentage for some of my friends tests but not all ways(some times 0 was better)
     because it was not disscussed please don't reduce me points for it.
     

notice:

- my code runs on U2 and has succesfuly passed the test you brought us + some other test pepole sent.



please give you full attention to my assigment because i put a lot of effort in to it, 


thank you for your time! :)
