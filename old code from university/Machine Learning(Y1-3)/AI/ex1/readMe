Hello, 

i wanted to clerify a few things,

first its importent to know that in A* algorithem i could change the visit order in _lt_
function in Node class and in that way lower the number of visits
,but for unity in answers i chose to pull the nodes from Queue in
the same order others did.

in addition i would like to add that i could output the cost of the algorithem (f(n)) 
but after alot of discussion with others we got to a conclusion it will be more logical
to output the length of the route.

last thing is about IDS, i was not sure if to reset my memory every run like we learned,
if i would do that my visit count was too low.

thank you in advance!
