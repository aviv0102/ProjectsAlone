hello,

please notice that my graphs and results are in a different file(.odt file that i created in ubuntu), i could not 
add them to the pdf so please don't reduce my grade for it.

also notice i added the .py of the second model and its results

*i sent the pdf and graphs both here and in the theoretical part*


you can also see that i explained the models and the parameters in the pdf,
and commented the python file.


enjoy :)


thank you.
